### Description
Simple application for reservation auditoriums on a specific time.
The application uses RESTful API for storing data and reading from a database.

The application should allow:
* reservation auditoriums for a specific date and time from 1 to 5 hours;
* users must have the ability to reserve auditoriums, edit, cancel and
  delete them;
* warn users about overlays :
  * two users cannot reserve an auditorium for the same time,
  * reservation times must not overlap.

The RESTful API is built using _Flask_ framework and _MySQL_ database.
